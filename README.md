Program is fully simulated, no input necessary

NOTE: SINGLE CHOICE QUESTION AND MULTICHOICE QUESTION HAVE SETCHOICES() METHOD TO SET THE CHOICES, HOWEVER
SINCE ANSWERS ARE SIMULATED, THE CHOICES HAVE BEEN PREDETERMINED IN THE METHOD CLASS ALREADY

ALSO, MULTICHOICE QUESTION STUDENTS ANSWERS ARE NOT RANDOMIZED, HOWEVER THEY HAVE BEEN TESTED WITH RANDOMIZED INPUTS
MULTIPLE TIMES. THIS IS DUE TO PARAMETER int... WHICH CANNOT HAVE RANDOMIZED INPUT DUE TO FORMATTING ISSUES

Run SimulationDriver.java to simulate program
